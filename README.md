# Earthquake information webapp 🌎

Earthquakes occur all over the world everyday.

Recently, a huge earthquake occurred in Turkey.
I was born in Japan, where earthquakes occur frequently, often two or three times a week. I was shocked by this news, as I had lived without earthquakes since I left Japan.

The reason why I chose this data for the development of data-driven web app was because I wanted to find out how often and in which regions of the world earthquakes occur. And I want to warn people who have never experienced an earthquake that this disaster could happen at any moment.

Due to data size regulations, the earthquake data is limited to the period 1st to 19th February 2023. Data is taken from [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program.](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/) which is open source.

## For setup

### Prerequisites

The following commands have already been installed.

* Python3
* pip
* sqlite3
* Heroku CLI


### Setup guide

Install dependencies using `pip`.

```commandline
pip install Flask gunicorn flask-bootstrap pytest
```

Start python application with this command.

```commandline
python3 app.py
```

Run `pytest` to ensure that the application works.

```commandline
cd ./test
python3 -m pytest
```

---

### Deploy to Heroku

Create setting files for `Heroku`.
`Requirement.txt` must be re-created each time new library is installed by pip. 

The integration between Heroku and Github is already set up, so a push to the main branch of this repogitory is triggered and deployed automatically.

```commandline
echo "web: gunicorn app:app --log-file=-" > Procfile

python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Restore earthquaked database

If data is lost or the database is corrupted, execute sqlite command with `earthquakes.db` to restore the database.

```commandline
cd ./data
sqlite3 earthquake_data.db < ./backup/earthquakes.sql
```
